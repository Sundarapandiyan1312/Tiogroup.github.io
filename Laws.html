        <h1>Physics Laws are important for exploring about space...</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Newton's Laws of Motion:</li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>First Law (Law of Inertia):</li>
                <p> An object at rest tends to stay at rest, 
                    and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same
                     direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.</p>
                <img src="D:\Desktop\PROJECT- T\web site for krishna\satelite pics\Newtons-first-law.png"/>
            <li>Second Law (F = ma):</li>
            <p>The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration.</p>
            <img src="D:\Desktop\PROJECT- T\web site for krishna\satelite pics\Newtons-second-law.png"/>
            <li>Third Law (Action and Reaction):</li>
            <p> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
            <img src="D:\Desktop\PROJECT- T\web site for krishna\satelite pics\Newtons-third-law.png"/>
            </ul>
            <p>Importance: Newton's laws are fundamental for understanding the motion of spacecraft, rockets,
                 and celestial bodies. They are vital in rocket propulsion and satellite trajectory calculations.</p>
            <li>Gravitational Law (Law of Universal Gravitation):</li>
            <p>All objects with mass attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their 
                masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p><p>Importance: Understanding
                 gravitational forces is essential for 
                calculating the orbits of satellites and spacecraft, as well as for planning missions to other celestial bodies.</p>

            <li>Orbit mechanics</li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Orbit:</li>
                <p>An orbit is the path that an object takes around another object in space due to gravitational attraction.
                     Orbits can be elliptical, circular, or hyperbolic, depending on the energy and velocity of the object.</p>

                    <li>Celestial Body</li>
                    <p>A celestial body refers to any natural object in space, 
                        such as planets, moons, stars, asteroids, comets, and galaxies.</p>

                     <li>Gravity</li>
                     <p>Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects with mass. In the context of orbital mechanics,
                         gravity is the dominant force that governs the motion of objects in space.</p>
                    <li>Semi-Major Axis</li>
                    <p>The semi-major axis is a fundamental parameter of an orbit. For an elliptical orbit,
                         it is the average distance from the center of the orbit to the farthest point. 
                        For a circular orbit, it is simply the radius of the orbit.</p>

                    <li>Orbital Inclination</li>
                    <p>Orbital inclination (i) is the angle between the plane of an orbit and a reference plane.
                         The reference plane is often the plane of the celestial body's equator.
                         </p>

                    <li>Orbital Period</li>
                    <p>The orbital period (T) is the time it takes for an object to complete one orbit around another object.
                         It is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler's third law.</p>
                    <li>Escape Velocity</li>
                    <p>Escape velocity is the minimum velocity an object must reach to break free from the gravitational influence of a celestial body.
                         It is the velocity required to escape to an infinite distance.</p>
                    <li>Orbital Velocity</li>
                    <p>Orbital velocity (v) is the minimum velocity required for an object to stay in a stable orbit around a celestial body. It is
                         the velocity that balances the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force due to the object's orbital motion.</p>
                    <li>Two-Body Problem</li>
                    <p>The two-body problem is a simplified model in celestial mechanics
                         that considers the motion of two point masses under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction.</p>
                </ul>
                <li>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</li>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>First Law (Law of Orbits)</li>
                    <p>Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one of the two foci.</p>
                    <img src="D:\Desktop\PROJECT- T\web site for krishna\satelite pics\Keplers-First-Law.jpg"/>
                    <li>Second Law (Law of Areas)</li>
                    <p>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time</p>
                    <img src="D:\Desktop\PROJECT- T\web site for krishna\satelite pics\keplers second law.webp"/>
                    <li>Third Law (Law of Periods)</li>
                    <p>The square of the orbital period of a planet is 
                        directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit</p>
